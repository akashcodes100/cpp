Q) Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node, we need to choose a subset of these nodes such that sum of chosen nodes is maximum under a constraint that no two chosen node in subset should be directly connected that is, if we have taken a node in our sum then we canâ€™t take its any children or parents in consideration and vice versa.

Example: 

                Input:
               11
              /  \
             1    2
          Output: 11
          Explanation: The maximum sum is sum of
          node 11.
